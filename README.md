<h4>Usage:</h4> 

	frank <filename.py>
	Ex. frank main.py

<h4>Warnings:</h4> 
	
<li>Frank does not work with wildcards because i havent figured that out yet in python.</li>
<li>He still has a few false flags, trust but verify his output.</li>
<li>Frank is not a replacement for PEP8, but rather something to be used along side of PEP8
because PEP8 Does not check for documentation that is mandatory for Holberton students. </li>
