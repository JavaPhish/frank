-   -   -
Usage: 

	frank <filename.py>
	Ex. frank main.py

Warnings:
	
	-Frank does not work with wildcards because i havent figured that out yet in python.
	-He still has a few false flags, trust but verify his output.
	-Frank is not a replacement for PEP8, but rather something to be used along side of PEP8
	because PEP8 Does not check for documentation that is mandatory for Holberton students.
